It's a to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help you understand the basics of web development and how to create interactive web pages.

###Explanation:

#HTML:

The basic structure includes an input field to enter tasks and a button to add tasks to the list.
The ul element will contain the list of tasks.

#CSS:

Styles for the body, container, input field, button, and task list.
Hover effect for the button and style for completed tasks.

#JavaScript:

addTask() function adds a new task to the list when the button is clicked.
Each task is added as an li element, and clicking on a task toggles its completion state.
You can now run this project by creating three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) with the respective code and opening index.html in your browser. This will create a simple interactive to-do list application.
